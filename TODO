  + Examples, documentation.

  + Fix error detection.
  + Fix error reporting in the solvers (warn always looks at errno).
  + Add a -q option to the solvers to suppress diagnostics.

  + Unify interfaces. SAT::Enumerator should provide the standard role
    for AllSAT solvers. Error types should be defined there as well.
    Taking DIMACS input even overlaps with the other variants of
    SAT solving.
  + All these things belong to the SAT module, which also contains
    Test::SAT::* packages based on the interfaces.

  + Configurability. Offer command-line options to callers.

  + Maybe export a sub that hides the object creation and maybe
    a version that automatically awaits the Promise.
