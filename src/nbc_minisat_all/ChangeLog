nbc_minisat_all v1.0.2 Released Apr. 1st 2018
========================================
* changed the type of cpu_time of printStats from int to unsigned long, to
void to wrap-around, and the type of cast inside printStats from float to
double.

nbc_minisat_all v1.0.1 Released Oct. 27th 2016
========================================
* modified signal handler.

nbc_minisat_all v1.0.0 Released Sep. 30th 2015
========================================
* This software is based on the memory efficient all-solutions SAT Solver
proposed by Grumberg et al. 2004. This is implemented on top of MiniSat-C v1.14.1.
See Grumberg, Orna and Schuster, Assaf and Yadgar, Avi: Memory Efficient
All-Solutions SAT Solver and Its Application for Reachability Analysis, Formal
Methods in Computer-Aided Design, LNCS Vol.3312, pp.275-289, 2004.
* The author of this software further extended it by adding decision
level-based first UIP scheme and several backtracking methods.
* Supported solution counting with GMP library.
* Supported interruption signal handling.

MiniSat-C v1.14.1
========================================

* Fixed some serious bugs. 
* Tweaked to be Visual Studio friendly (by Alan Mishchenko).
  This disabled reading of gzipped DIMACS files and signal handling, but none
  of these features are essential (and easy to re-enable, if wanted).

MiniSat-C v1.14
========================================

Ok, we get it. You hate C++. You hate templates. We agree; C++ is a
seriously messed up language. Although we are more pragmatic about the
quirks and maldesigns in C++, we sympathize with you. So here is a
pure C version of MiniSat, put together by Niklas Sörensson.
